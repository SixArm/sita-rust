## Template engines

Sita is being developed to use multiple template engines:

* Handlebars - because of speed and use by the Rust language.

* Askama - because of popularity within the Rust ecosystem.

* Tera - because of advanced capabilities and pure Rust.

* Liquid - because of popularity with e-commerce developers.
